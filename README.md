# Overview
The focus of this project is to design and implement data structures and algorithms that ensure efficient order handling and delivery management.

# 🍕 Pizza Delivery System – Data Structures & Algorithms Project

The system should support:  
- Ordering pizza  
- Canceling an order  
- Controlling the delivery process

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply **data structures** (queues, stacks, linked lists, etc.) to manage orders and deliveries.  
- Implement **algorithms** for processing orders efficiently.  
- To demonstrate **problem-solving skills** in real-world scenarios.  
- To Practice **clean coding** and **modular design**.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 🔹 Data Structures/Algorithms Used
1. Primary Data Structure: Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)

Implementation: Custom linked list implementation

Purpose: To manage pizza orders in the order they are received (first-come, first-served)


2. Specific Queue Operations & Algorithms:

3. Additional Algorithms/Techniques:

Exception Handling: Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout the codebase

Input Validation: Checks for empty strings, negative order IDs, and duplicate order IDs

Menu-driven Interface: Switch-case structure with user input handling
