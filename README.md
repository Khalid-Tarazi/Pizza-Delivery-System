# 🍕 Pizza Delivery System – Data Structures & Algorithms Project

The system should support:  
- Ordering pizza  
- Canceling an order  
- Controlling the delivery process

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply **data structures** (queues, stacks, linked lists, etc.) to manage orders and deliveries.  
- Implement **algorithms** for processing orders efficiently.  
- Demonstrate **problem-solving skills** in real-world scenarios.  
- Practice **clean coding** and **modular design**.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 🔹 Data Structures Used
- **Queue** → To manage pizza orders in a FIFO manner.  
- **Stack** → For handling canceled orders (e.g., storing last canceled order).  
- **Linked List / ArrayList** → To maintain active customer orders.  
- **HashMap** → To quickly lookup orders by order ID.  

### 🔹 Algorithms
- **Order Placement** → Add to queue.  
- **Order Cancellation** → Pop from stack or remove from active list.  
- **Delivery Control** → Dequeue for delivery in correct order.  
- **Efficiency** → Minimized lookup and retrieval times.
